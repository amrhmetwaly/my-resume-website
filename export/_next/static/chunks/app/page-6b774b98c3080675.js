He created our Test Plan and automated our end-to-end integration testing using Cypress which he had no prior knowledge of at the time. A few months after that he had the desire to dive into more application development, so we got him into React. He and I worked closely on the front-end development. It was great being able to mentor Amr in web development. He was eager to learn and asked a lot of questions. I really enjoyed our paired-programming sessions. Sometimes mistakes happened - some small regressions were introduced - but Amr was on top of it. He always responded to feedback from code reviews and learned from those mistakes. Over time those were less and less and, as a Team, we all fell into a great rhythm. Amr was part of a small team of 3 developers, but we are top performers and got stuff done.
